## The Game Has Changed

Remember when getting a job was about being qualified? Now it's about gaming an algorithm.

Whether it's a startup or Fortune 500, companies use ATS to search and rank resumes. These systems don't reject you â€” they make you invisible. Wrong keywords = buried in their database while less qualified but better-optimized resumes rise to the top.

**jobheist** is your inside edge. It analyzes your resume against any job posting, shows you exactly what the ATS is looking for, and tells you what's missing. Consider it reconnaissanceâ€”knowing exactly what they're looking for before you make your move.

**Time to even the odds.**

## How It Works

```bash
jobheist resume.pdf https://dream-company.com/perfect-role

# In seconds, you'll know:
# âœ“ Your ATS compatibility score (0-100)
# âœ“ Keywords you're missing
# âœ“ Skills they want that you haven't mentioned
# âœ“ Specific suggestions to improve your match
```

Powered by [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.com)'s intelligent scraping and OpenAI's latest models. Just 2 files, ~850 linesâ€”because the best tools don't need to be complicated.

## Quick Start

```bash
# One-time play
npx jobheist resume.pdf https://jobs.example.com/posting

# Or keep it in your arsenal
npm install -g jobheist
jobheist resume.pdf https://dream-company.com/perfect-role
```

## The Intel

You wouldn't rob a bank without casing it first. **jobheist** gives you:

- **Match Score** â€” Your probability of passing the ATS filter (0-100)
- **Missing Keywords** â€” The exact terms they're scanning for that you don't have
- **Skill Gaps** â€” Technologies and competencies to add (if you have them)
- **Strategic Recommendations** â€” Specific changes to improve your odds
- **Confidence Indicators** â€” How certain we are about each finding

## Setup

### API Keys

You'll need two keys for this operation:
- **OpenAI** â€” For the analysis engine ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- **Firecrawl** â€” For job scraping ([Get one here](https://firecrawl.com))

Configure them however suits your style:

**The Mastermind** (Global Config)
```bash
# Set once, use everywhere
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx" >> ~/.jobheistrc
echo "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc_xxx" >> ~/.jobheistrc
chmod 600 ~/.jobheistrc  # Keep it secure
```

**The Ghost** (Environment Variables)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc_xxx
```

**The Planner** (Local .env)
```bash
# In your project directory
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx" >> .env
echo "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc_xxx" >> .env
```

**The Freelancer** (CLI Flags)
```bash
jobheist resume.pdf https://job-url \
  --openai-key=sk-xxx \
  --firecrawl-key=fc_xxx
```

> **Note**: Priority order is CLI flags â†’ env vars â†’ .env â†’ ~/.jobheistrc

## For Developers

Building your own crew? Here's how to integrate:

```typescript
import { ats, atsStream } from 'jobheist'

// Quick analysis
const score = await ats('resume.pdf', 'https://example.com/job')

// Real-time progress tracking
await atsStream('resume.pdf', 'https://example.com/job', {
  onProgress: (update) => {
    console.log(`Phase: ${update.phase}`)
  }
})
```

See the [API Reference](./docs/api-reference.mdx) for complete documentation and [Progress Phases](./docs/progress-phases.mdx) for detailed callback documentation.
