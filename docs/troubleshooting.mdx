# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### API Key Errors

**Error:** `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY required` or `OPENAI_API_KEY required`

**Solution:** Set your API keys using one of these methods:

1. **Environment variables:**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
   export FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc_xxx
   ```

2. **Global config file:**
   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx" >> ~/.jobheistrc
   echo "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc_xxx" >> ~/.jobheistrc
   chmod 600 ~/.jobheistrc
   ```

3. **Command line flags:**
   ```bash
   jobheist resume.pdf https://job-url \
     --openai-key=sk-xxx \
     --firecrawl-key=fc_xxx
   ```

### PDF Parsing Issues

**Error:** `Failed to parse PDF` or empty resume text

**Solutions:**
- Ensure the PDF is not password-protected
- Try converting to a different PDF format
- Check that the PDF contains selectable text (not just images)
- Verify the file path is correct and accessible

### Job Scraping Failures

**Error:** `Failed to scrape job posting`

**Solutions:**
- Verify the job URL is accessible in a browser
- Try with `--max-age=0` to bypass cache
- Check if the job posting requires authentication
- Ensure the URL is a direct link to the job posting, not a search results page

### Network/Timeout Issues

**Error:** Timeout or network errors

**Solutions:**
- Check your internet connection
- Try again with `--max-age=0`
- Verify API keys are valid and have sufficient credits
- Check if your network blocks the required services

### Memory Issues

**Error:** Out of memory or process crashes

**Solutions:**
- Ensure you have sufficient RAM (recommended: 2GB+)
- Try with smaller PDF files
- Close other memory-intensive applications
- Consider using the streaming API (`atsStream`) for large files

## Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=jobheist:* jobheist resume.pdf https://job-url
```

This will show detailed information about the analysis process.

## Performance Tips

### For Large PDFs
- Use `atsStream` instead of `ats` for better memory management
- Consider splitting very large resumes into smaller sections

### For Slow Networks
- Use `--max-age=0` sparingly (it bypasses cache)
- Consider running during off-peak hours

### For Batch Processing
- Use JSON format for programmatic processing
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Consider rate limiting for API calls

## Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the logs** - Look for specific error messages
2. **Try the examples** - Test with the provided examples first
3. **Verify setup** - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
4. **Check API status** - Verify Firecrawl and OpenAI services are operational

## Known Limitations

- **PDF parsing:** Only supports text-based PDFs, not image-only PDFs
- **Job scraping:** Some job sites may block automated scraping
- **Rate limits:** API providers may have rate limits
- **File size:** Very large PDFs may cause memory issues

## Error Codes

| Error | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY required` | Missing Firecrawl API key | Set API key via env var or config |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY required` | Missing OpenAI API key | Set API key via env var or config |
| `Failed to parse PDF` | PDF parsing error | Check PDF format and accessibility |
| `Failed to scrape job posting` | Job scraping error | Verify URL and try with --max-age=0 |
| `Generation failed` | AI analysis error | Check API keys and try again |
