- **ü•á 60-79**: Good match - Solid foundation with room for optimization  
- **‚ö†Ô∏è 40-59**: Moderate match - Consider the suggestions to strengthen alignment
- **üö® 0-39**: Limited match - Significant improvements recommended

## Real-World Example

**Analyzing ATS Compatibility for Vercel DX Engineer**

I need to produce a markdown document that includes specified headings, emphasizes keywords, and includes a compatibility score. I should summarize which keywords are important, distinguishing between exact matches and near-misses, alongside the pass probability. I'll suggest actionable improvements with exact phrases for the resume content.

Micah has a robust background with over 15 years of experience and specific technologies like Next.js, React, TypeScript, and more. I'll focus on ensuring the resume aligns well with ATS behavior.

‚úÖ Analysis complete!

# ATS Compatibility Report ‚Äî DX Engineer, Education (Vercel)

**Compatibility score: 82%**  
Summary: The resume contains many high-value ATS keywords (React, Next.js, Vercel, curriculum design, developer education, technical writing). Missing are a few exact phrase matches the job explicitly implies (`8+ years` phrasing, `developer education at scale` exact wording, `CLIs`/`git-like CMS` phrasing). With targeted, truthful phrase additions this resume will very likely pass an automated keyword screen.

---

## What ATS actually filters on (what matters here)
- High-value filters (actual ATS tokens to satisfy)
  - **Technologies & tools**: `React`, `React.js`, `Next.js`, `Vercel`, `TypeScript`, `Supabase`, `Postgres`
  - **Exact experience quantities**: `8+ years`, `15+ years`, `5+ years`, etc.
  - **Role-specific phrases**: `developer education`, `curriculum development`, `technical writing`
  - **Infrastructure terms**: `CLI`, `CLI tools`, `APIs`, `content management system`, `CMS`, `git-like CMS`
  - **Job title / domain**: `Developer Experience`, `DX Engineer`, `Education`
- Low-value (rarely filtered)
  - Soft adjectives: `innovative`, `polished`, `self-starter` (these matter to humans, not ATS)
  - Generic leadership copy without keywords

> Key insight: ATS looks for token matches in required/skills fields. Exact string forms matter (see below). Put critical phrases in summary, skills, and bullets under jobs.

---

## Exact matches vs near-misses

| Job requirement / keyword | Resume status | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `React` | Exact match | Appears in bullets and tech list. Good. |
| `Next.js` | Exact match (`Next.js`) | Good. |
| `React.js` / `ReactJS` | Near-miss/optional | Resume uses `React` and `React Server Components`. Add `React.js`/`ReactJS` variants if ATS expects them. |
| `8+ years building production web applications` | Near-miss | Resume says `15+ years` in summary but does not include the exact `8+ years` phrase nor `building production web applications` as a single token. Add explicit phrase. |
| `Proven track record creating developer education at scale` | Near-match | Strong signals: General Assembly and League reach many users, but the exact phrasing `developer education at scale` and `reaching thousands` are not a single ATS token. Add explicit phrase with numbers. |
| `Engineering skills to build/maintain CLIs, APIs, CMS` | Partial match | Resume lists platform engineering, CI/CD, CMS-like work, but `CLI`, `git-like CMS`, and `content management system` tokens are not explicit. Add them. |
| `Exceptional technical writing` | Partial match | `Technical writing` and `documentation systems` exist ‚Äî add `Exceptional technical writing` phrase to match requirement. |
| `Self-directed` / `extreme ownership` | Near-miss | Implicit via founder/lead roles, but not the exact phrase. Add exact token. |
| `Passion for empowering developers` | Near-miss | Implicit; add exact phrase for ATS. |

---

## Realistic pass probability (based on typical ATS behavior)
- **Automated keyword screen (strict parsing of required tokens): ~85%** ‚Äî many required technologies and education signals are present. Missing exact tokens lower this slightly.
- **Human/recruiter screen after ATS pass: ~60%** ‚Äî strong real-world fit, but needs clearer, explicit phrasing of scale, infrastructure, and DX-specific language to jump to "must-interview."

> Warning: Small exact-phrase differences (e.g., `React` vs `React.js`, or lack of `8+ years`) are common reasons resumes fall out of automated screens.

## Specific, actionable edits ‚Äî exact phrases to add and where

Add these exact phrases (copy-paste) in the indicated locations. Be truthful; these are phrasing edits, not new claims.

### Top summary / headline (directly under name)
- Add line:
  - `8+ years building production web applications with deep expertise in React, Next.js, and the modern web ecosystem`
- Add keywords:
  - `Developer Experience (DX) Engineer | Developer Education | Technical Writer`

Example single-line summary to insert or replace an existing summary sentence:
- `15+ years designing and building web products ‚Äî 8+ years building production web applications with deep expertise in React, Next.js, and the modern web ecosystem. Developer Experience (DX) Engineer focused on developer education and technical writing.`

### Skills / Technical Skills section
Add tokens (comma-separated or in the bullets):
- `React.js, React, ReactJS`
- `Next.js, Nextjs`
- `CLI tools / CLIs`
- `APIs (REST & GraphQL)`
- `Content management systems (CMS) / git-like CMS`
- `Developer Experience (DX)`

### General Assembly role (under bullets)
Add a bullet:
- `Proven track record creating developer education at scale: designed courses and curriculum reaching thousands across 14 international markets.`

### The League / Founder role (under bullets)
Add a bullet:
- `Built and maintained content platforms and educational infrastructure (APIs, CMS, membership systems) supporting 35,000+ subscribers and curriculum reaching millions.`

### Wildebeest / Tech Lead bullets
Add or modify a bullet:
- `Built developer-facing tools and educational infrastructure including CLIs, internal APIs, and CMS integrations; deployed on Vercel.`

### Teaching & Education or Technical Writing section
Add lead sentence:
- `Exceptional technical writing and instructional design ‚Äî able to make complex concepts accessible through practical examples and reproducible labs.`

### Soft/ownership phrasing (summary or bullet near top)
Add one-line:
- `Self-directed with extreme ownership ‚Äî I ship without waiting for permission and iterate on developer-facing instruction and platforms.`

---

## Minimal edits checklist (apply these 6 places)
- Summary: add `8+ years building production web applications with deep expertise in React, Next.js`
- Summary: add `Developer Experience (DX) Engineer`
- Tech skills: add `React.js`, `ReactJS`, `Nextjs`, `CLI`, `CMS`, `git-like CMS`
- GA bullets: add `developer education at scale` + `reaching thousands`
- League bullets: add `educational infrastructure`, `CMS`, `APIs`, `35,000+ subscribers`
- Teaching section: add `Exceptional technical writing`

---

> Final note: The resume is strong for this role. The ATS gap is mostly about exact-token matches and explicit scale / infrastructure phrases. Make the short, truthful insertions above and you'll significantly increase both ATS pass rate and recruiter confidence.
